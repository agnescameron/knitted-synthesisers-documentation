### conductive yarn and variable resistors

Typically, conductive yarn is used differently to conductive thread: it has much higher resistance, which means that it's not used to directly connect components unless they are very close together. However, because the conductive properties of fabrics knitted with conductive yarns change according to the state of the material, they make great sensors.

When a knitted sample is relaxed, it has a high resistance as the fibres in the yarn do not make contact with one another, meaning that current can pass only along a few strands. When the sample is stretched, however, the fibres are pulled into closer contact, reducing the resistance and allowing the flow of an electric current. This means that the inclusion of a conductive yarn allows you to sense movement in the material, creating a stretch sensor.

## practice

### you will need
* 3.5mm jack breakout (socket)
* a speaker or pair of headphones
* a breadboard
* 2x 555 timers
* jumper wires
* 5V power supply
* 4 crocodile clip cables
* a 68kΩ resistor
* a 8.2kΩ resistor
* a 10k variable resistor
* a 100k variable resistor
* some conductive knit samples

### how to measure resistance using a multimeter 

Attach the crocodile clips to the edge of the sample, and connect the other ends to the multimeter. Move the wheel of the multimeter to the setting with the Ω symbol, and press the 'mode' button until you also see a Ω on the screen.

Once the system is connected, you should see a reading of the sample's resistance on the multimeter. Try stretching the sample and the number should decrease! Note that the letters next to Ω refer to the magnitude: k stands for 'kilo' (x1000), and M stands for 'mega' (x 10,000). You want your sample to be at least a few kΩ for this to work.

### how to read circuit diagrams



calculating resistor and capacitor size

the smaller the capacitor, the less time it will take to fill up, and the higher the frequency

the smaller

* breadboard
* 1/4" jack breakout
* a sample of knitting made with conductive yarn (measure the resistance)
* a resistor with the same resistance
